# salom24.github.io

[GitHub Page](https://salom24.github.io) to present myself and add some notes.

To test the page locally:

- Check that `bundle` is installed.
- Set the install path with `bundle config --local path 'vendor/bundle'`.
- Optionally, in `_config.yml` uncomment `theme: "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"` and comment `remote_theme: "mmistakes/minimal-mistakes"`.
- Install dependencies with `bundle install`.
- Serve the page with `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
